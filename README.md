# WordPress Starter Theme

The DesignHammer WordPress Starter theme is a _hybrid_ theme based on [Underscores](https://underscores.me/), that has been reconfigured to our workflow.

## What is a hybrid theme?

A **hybrid WordPress theme** uses theme.json to define styles and customize the block editor while also using traditional PHP template files.

Hybrid themes leverage the block editor for content but not for building the theme itself. **Block themes** use the new Site Editor for building and customizing the theme directly in the block editor.

1. Search and replace every instenace of the following three word instances with the new theme name. "STARTER", "Starter", and "starter".
